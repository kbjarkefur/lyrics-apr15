Stop!
Five
He shut his eyes and came out on "Wear no shookballs"
Don't worry if you don't get the vocal, just keep going
Ok, sorry
Yes, I get very involved, you know?
One, two, a one, two, three, four
Here come old flat top, he come groovin' up slowly
He got ju-ju eyeballs, he's one holy roller
He got hair down to his knees
He's got to be a joker, he just do what he please
Shoot me
Shoot me
Shoot me
Shoot me
Look out!
He wear no shoeshine, he got toe-jam football
He got monkey finger, he shoot Coca-Cola
He say, "I know you, you know me"
One thing I can tell you, you just got to be free
Come together, right now
Over me
Shoot me
Shoot me
Shoot me
Hey!
He's bad productions, he's got walrus gumboot
He's got Ono sideburns, he's one spinal cracker
He's got feet down below his knees
He holds you in his arms, yeah you can feel his disease
Come together, right now
Over me
Yeah
Hey!
He come groovin' up slowly
He got ju-ju eyeballs, he's one holy roller
He got hair down to his knees
He's got to be a joker, he just do what he please, look out!
He's roller-coaster, he got early warnin'
He's got Doris dockers-
Early warning
Yes
A man like him would have it
He's got teenage lyrics, he's got hot rod bowling
I'm losing my cool
